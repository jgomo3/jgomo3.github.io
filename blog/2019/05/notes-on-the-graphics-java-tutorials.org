#+TITLE: Notes on the Graphics Java Tutorials

The first thing you would notice on the java tutorials today is the warning
about they being wrote for the Java 8 version. And in the Graphics tutorials,
the first thing that took my attention was the usage of Applets for the
examples.

So I rewrote the examples to avoid using the Applets. The other thing I noticed,
was that while learning, I actually preferred to see the explicit classes
imported instead of the wildcard (*) importing. This is because it is useful to
learn where are the classes being classified in the namespace of Java, while
reading the examples, something that the wildcard obfuscate.
